I'm trying out Quarto to make a website that allows for writing posts involving math and code.

For example, I can write equations like this:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
$$

And I can write code like this:

```{python}
1 + 1
```

I can also use packages such as matplotlib and numpy.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

Not bad!
